:help;Help!

KevEdit includes a fully functional help
system, as you are very much aware since
you are reading this.
!-kobjedit:help;Object Editor Help

:quit;Quitting

For your safety, pressing 'q' will ask if
you really want to quit.  If you answer in
the affirmative, KevEdit will terminate.
It will not ask you if you really /really/
want to quit, or perhaps you would just
like to save your work instead, because I
hate it when programs doubt my quititude.

:enjoy;Enjoy!

We hope you enjoy using KevEdit as much as
we enjoyed creating it. Feedback is always
welcome; we'd love to hear what you think
of our work.
